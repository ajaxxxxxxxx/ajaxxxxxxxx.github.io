**READ BEFORE CONTINUING:**

1.) Please do not bother any mod authors with troubleshooting questions regarding this mod list. Even if you think your question pertains to the mod itself, please ask in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zuNrZWyQYt).

2.) You MUST follow this guide in the order given and word for word. If you do not you will experience issues. Please read through it at least once prior to install

3.) This mod pack is not a vanilla+ experience. It is a major overhaul of the game.


**Pre-Installation Checklist**

* 120GB of free space

* A Nexus Account

* Anniversary Edition Upgrade

Why does it Need to be Anniversary Edition?: Because the modpack was made with all cc content from AE 1.6.640

* A FRESH GLOBAL STEAM installation (Any Non Steam versions are not compatible) of Skyrim Anniversary Edition

* [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

* Nexus Premium is a HUGE SUGGESTION

* The [Wabbajack Launcher](https://www.wabbajack.org/)

Why does it Need to be Steam Global?: This is due to Wabbajack functionality/how I have set up the way Wabbajack downloads the mod pack.

* Your Steam Library in a Non-protected directory (I do the surface of my drive)

Protected libraries are Program Files, Your Desktop, Etc.([Tutorial Here](https://www.howtogeek.com/257472/how-to-painlessly-move-your-steam-library-to-another-folder-or-hard-drive/))

**Starting Off…**

Install Skyrim SE. After it's installed, run it once, get to the main menu and install all CC content. Once done close the game.

Make sure old installations are completely deleted and reinstalled, **especially if they have been previously modded**

Make sure any pre-existing ini’s are deleted so they game can build them again post installation. These can be found in Documents > My Games > Skyrim Special Edition most commonly

Make sure your Skyrim is set to the English language as other languages are not supported.

**Final Sidenote**

When you have finished this guide, you will have two installations of Skyrim. The one you downloaded through Steam and the one that was compiled by Wabbajack.
The One Compiled by Steam will be in your typical steam directory

The One Compiled by Wabbajack will be in the folder where wabbajack will deliver all of the files (Whatever path you choose in Wabbajack\Stock Game)

YOU WILL NOT BE EDITING YOUR ORIGINAL STEAM PATH. MO2 AND THIS MODPACK WILL WORK OFF OF THE STOCK GAME FOLDER. ANY PATHS YOU SET, EDITS YOU MAKE, ETC SHOULD BE DONE TO THE STOCK GAME FOLDER GRANTED THEY ARE IN THE INSTALLATION GUIDE**
