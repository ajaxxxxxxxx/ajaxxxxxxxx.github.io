# Hardcore Needs

:::danger
## THIS IS A PAGE FOR HARDCORE USERS ONLY
:::

After tweaking the game to your liking and determining your character’s origins, it is now time to survive the harsh wastes. A number of mods have made this game much more challenging, but also fair. Unless you are constantly mashing your sprint key, hydration should last you up to 3 days before becoming critically important. In addition, you should be able to last without food for several days without noticing any effects. As for sleep, you can go upwards of a month without it. That being said, your needs still do matter and they will creep up on you before you know it. This is why knowing how to provide for yourself in the harsh wastes is important

## **Shelter**

The Mojave & the Capital Wasteland are places of varying weather conditions. Hot days will dehydrate your quicker while rainy days will dampen you. All of these, whilst affecting hardcore needs, may also serve to affect other skill modifiers. This is why establishing shelter is a necessity. Other reasons are as follows...

**1.)** Your carry weight has been significantly reduced. Finding a place to rest your head and store your gear, whether it be in a tent, mobile RV, or one of the many player homes throughout the wastes is important

**2.)** Many player homes throughout the wastes host crafting stations for armor and weapon repairs, chem crafting, food preparation, and purification of water. These are all important processes to make sure you are prepared for your journeys.

**3.)** Healing and assessing player condition is important. The wasteland has been beefed up with many more spawns and much more dangerous enemies. It is best to retreat to your home and find out how to best recover rather than sitting in the middle of the wastes where any manner of man or beast could attack.

We will leave it to you to find these player homes on your adventures

## **Ambient Temperature**

The Mojave & The Capital Wasteland, like the real world, suffer from their cool and warmer days. Things like temperature, dew point, heat index, and relative humidity will affect all of your hardcore needs. These can all be checked in your Pipboy Module labeled `Today's Weather` in your Pipboy's Armr Section. If it is hot out, think about wearing lighter armor/clothing. If its warm, do the opposite. As simplistic as this system is, it can cause catastrophic differences in your overall survival if you are not properly prepared. 

## **Hardcore Needs: Thirst**

Like in a real life survival scenario, thirst is the first thing that kills many. Unlike in the real world, however, levelling up your survival can turn this from a burdenous and even expensive task to nothing more than an occasional annoyance. 

- Sprinting, no matter what level you are, will increase your thirst at dramatically faster rates than moving regularly.
