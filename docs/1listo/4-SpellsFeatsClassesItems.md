# Spells, Feats, & Class Items

## New Spells

**5e, Homebrew, Spells Extra, Pathfinder 2e, Mystra Spells, and Veenab Spells, Water Spells, and More**

[5e Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/125) adds a variety of tabletop spells missing from BG3. 
[Homebrew Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/473) adds a small selection of additional 0th - 5th level spells.
[Spells Extra](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11291) is used to cover any missing spells needed by Luma's various subclass mods.
[PF2e Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2460) has been patched by myself, adding another ~60 spells to the game based on PF2e spells (but rebalanced to fit BG3).
Mystra's Spells from Mod.io is used in Listo. Specifically, a limited selection of the spells that do not already exist in 5e spells.
Veenab's Spells is in Listo. This primarily adds several spells to Warlocks themed around invoking more Great Old Ones, but that is not all that is added.
Water Spells adds a number of hydro-themed options.
Valkrana's, Dawnstars, and Xara add even more spells alongside Book of Ebon Tides and other smaller mods.

**Many of these spells are available to your enemies**, so be on your toes!

## Spell Rebalances

**A blend of Valdacil, Syrchalis, Cahoot, myself, and others**

Listonomicon has spent a lot of time rebalancing spells to meet the needs of a coherent cRPG, compared to the various design inspirations behind each spell (such as RAW adherence in some mods versus homebrew in others).

Illithid Powers are [significantly revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5105?tab=files) with Illithid Powers Overhaul 2. If you choose to use the astral tadpole, Illithid Powers are very powerful in Act 3.

My fork/patch of the PF2e Spells mod rebalances and fixes several spells. Phase Bolt is less powerful, for example, applying only a -1 AC per effect stack instead of -2. Other features of the mod (such as the action -> bonus action conversion and other PF2e features that are not spells) are removed.

Cahoot has supplied his own rebalance for Color Spray and the Sleep spells, which alters them to saving throws and forcse Sleep to respect sylvan immunity to sleep effects. These spells should no longer be useless vs the higher enemy HP in Listo, without being overpowered.

## New and Changed Feats

In Listonomicon, all classes earn a feat at a rate of one per 3 levels. Fighters and Rogues earn an additional feat at level 11. So all classes get a feat at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18; Fighters, Mesmerists, and Rogues get a feat at 3, 6, 9, **11**, 12, 15, and 18.

The [Arcanist Feat](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1087) allows you to gain +1 INT, gain expertise in Arcana, and learn any level 1 spell which can be casted once per short rest. Consider how various level 1 spells (such as Shield of Faith) have been rebalanced. That's basically a free +2 AC for anyone who would not otherwise have access to the spell, such as an Eldritch Knight. Clerics or Monks may want to use it for access to Shillelagh.

The Improved Poison Equipment mod adds a Poison version of the Elemental Adept feat. If you stack two sources of the ability (such as taking the feat while wearing The Poisoner's Robe), enemy poison immunity will be downgraded to poison resistance. A Green Dragonborn Circle of Spores Druid who takes the feat and wears the Poisoner's Robe would get the benefits of the feat (reroll 1's, ignore resistance) for their breath weapon, spore attack, and poison damage spells.

[Essential Feats](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5623) adds a great variety of feats. For multiclass melee-caster builds, War Magic allows you to combine casting with weapon swinging. Specifically, after casting a spell or cantrip you can make 1 attack as a bonus action. This is different from, and does not stack with, Eldritch Knight's similar feature that allows cantrips to be used with multiattack. This is especially great for Clerics who otherwise do not get access to extra attack or war priest extra attack, as you can combine a cast and a swing every turn. Deadly Alacrity reduces the number needed to roll a crit (stacks with any/other crit chance increase effects) and restores mobility for hits and kills. Alchemist turns anyone into a potion throwing utility character and makes it possible to brew 2 potions instead of 1. Various Initiate, Touched, and Adept feats give limited access to the features of other classes such as a fighting maneuvers, eldritch invocations, or metamagic. Using these feats is an alternative to Arcanist, and the user gains 2 cantrips and 1 spell of 1st level. A great use of these feats is to get Shillelagh as a non-Nature Cleric or Monk, without needing to dip into Druid. A Sorcerer or Bard could pick up eldritch blast, another Warlock cantrip, and Mage Armor.

Vanilla feats are heavily altered by the hard work of Cahoot, who helped Ajax implement many ideas, improve on other Nexus mods, or straight up designed his own improvements. [You can read about them here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2yhpaMBaue98rkjhEPYIjSmtUwiw1tc8KqhK7FJMak/edit?usp=sharing). These rebalances include altering Great Weapon Master and Sharpshooter. You effectively sacrifice getting a proficiency bonus on your attack roll, to instead get a proficiency bonus on your damage roll. Other important changes include Tough (which comes with +1 CON) and Durable (which comes with a proficiency bonus scaling damage resistance). A Durable + Mageslayer Cleric, Paladin, Barbarian, or Fighter is very formidable and can form an essential anchor and tank for your team! Tavern Brawler is significantly less powerful. Dual Wielder is altered by [Dual Wielding Master](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1304). You can make a normal attack with two weapons using your action and bonus action, or you can toggle swinging both weapons with a single action. If using both weapons in a single action, you receive a -3 penalty to attack rolls, but this allows you to combine multiattack with dual wielding and compete with the relative power of Great Weapon Master, or using a dueling fighting style and shield.

[Enweaved](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13310) adds a way to get +2 in INT, WIS, or CHA - but be warned, it comes with wild magic and _wild magic allergy_! This can help a caster reach 22 in their casting stat (and get to 24 with Hag's Hair + the relevant Tome) but it will make casting spells, and being around spellcasting, a dangerous gambit.

[Experimental Alchemy as a Feat](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12446) provides another way to get access to Experimental Alchemy, which potentially causes two potions to be brewed instead of one when using alchemy. Note that multiple ExpAlch sources do not stack (eg Wizard + Artificer + this feat would still only produce 2 potions).

[Dirty Fighting](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14049) grants players a bonus action attack that, if successful, will knock an opponent "Off Balance" - granting advantage for melee attacks. This is a great choice for sword-and-shield Fighters who otherwise may not use their bonus action very often, as well as melee Rogues who want a reliable setup for Sneak Attack. Beware, enemy Fighters and Rogues will be using this when you reach Baldur's Gate!

# New and Changed Classes and Subclasses

It's going to take a while to write up what each these changes does to the game.

## General Changes and Additions

[Expansion Level 13-20](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/279)

Adds level scaling up to level 20. Also implements several changes/optional rules introduced with Tasha's Cauldron of Everything and other publications.

## Wild Magic

These mods affect wild magic sorcerers, wild magic barbarians, and/or other situations where the wild magic effects table is rolled such as certain wild magic enemies, enemies with Controlled Chaos, or having the Enweaved feat. Sorcerers and creatures with wild magic should only accrue surge risk during combat, meaning out-of-combat uses of spells like Healing Word or Longstrider or Feather Fall will not increase the surge risk. In combat, the risk increases by 5% per spell casted until a surge is triggered. For player Sorcerers, you can avoid starting the wild magic risk slide by avoiding using Tides of Chaos, but that would be boring. Wild magic surges will restore Tides of Chaos, allowing you to keep it going multiple times throughout an adventuring day. Wild Magic Sorcerers in Listonomicon are a whacky risk-reward gameplay experience.

* [More Wild Magic effects](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2022)
* [Wild Magic D100 Table](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2967)
* [Increasingly Likely Wild Magic Surge](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9603) (Combat Only)

[If Volo dies for any reason](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4030), the Weave will begin unraveling and _all magic becomes wild magic_.

## Barbarian

[Dynamic Wildheart Barbarian](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/8274) changes Wildheart Barbarians (aka "Totem") to be able to change which animal aspect is called upon when raging, which makes the subclass easier to adapt to different situations. Bear remains the most immediately powerful option (try combining the Durable feat with a Bear rage and Mageslayer, and laugh as enemies struggle to damage you!) but you can experiment more with situations where the other totems might be useful.

[5e Reckless Attack Toggle](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10924) changes the Reckless Attack feature from a reaction, to a toggled status.

## Cleric

[Blessing of the Trickster](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11566) is buffed to apply to more skills, and can be activated during dialogue similar to the Guidance spell. Trickery Clerics are a little less bad. Death Clerics can attempt to control their undead foes.

## Druid

[Druid Quality of Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/3214) is a QoL mod (duh) that changes many spells, effects, and magic items to interact with wildshape among other fixes.

[Circle of the Spores Druid Damage Choice](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11252) gives Spore druids the choice of dealing extra necrotic, acid, or poison damage with their class abilities, reducing how much this class suffers in Act 2 and creating new paths for synergy. [Combined with Spore Druid Extra Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/4018) and the improved Shillelagh spell, Spore Druids are a very respectable frontline melee combat/utility cast/healer and a good choice for players who want to play a Druid but do not want to use Wildshape.

Druids always have Speak With Animals prepared. They gain find familiar and flock of familiar at the appropriate levels. The Goodberry spell is buffed. Shilelagh is more powerful, is a permanent effect, and applies to a wider variety of weapons. Animal summons are improved. While Druids may not have many subclasses added, they are significantly better in Listo.

## Fighter

Eldritch Knight weapon bonds are permanent, similar to Warlock Pact of the Blade weapon bonds. You no longer need to remember to redo your bond every morning. Eldritch Knihts in general are improved with better flow between mixing spells, cantrips, and extra attack.

## Monk

[Monk 5e Adjustments](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1411) makes key QoL changes to various aspects of monks, such as supporting unarmed strikes even while you have a weapon in your hands.

Monks have [special magical unarmed attacks](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/17666).

## Paladin

You are able to start the game as an Oathbreaker Paladin. However, as a limitation of BG3, this will block you from normal respec and require you to use console commands or deal with the Oathbreaker Knight.

Smites that once required concentration should not anymore. Oathbreakers should feel more like their own class, with unholy smites and other features to distinguish themselves from the oaths they broke.

## Rogue

[Second-Story Work Dexterity Jump](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6331) changes the benefit of Second-Story Work to allow your jump to scale based on your Dexterity, instead of Strength. [Cunning Strike](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/507) allows Rogues to forgoe extra damage and instead get some kind of special effect for sneak attacks.

## Sorcerer

[Tides of Chaos Recharge](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11625) changes ToC to reset after a wild magic surge is caused, allowing you to use it multiple times per long rest (and risk multiple surges throughout the day as a result). [Metamagic Extended](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/405) implements more metamagic options from the tabletop game. The metamagic to change the damage type of your spell requires activating the metamagic, and then selecting an element out of the new pop-up options. Expand the section of your hotbar that has metamagic in it to see the new options. [Draconic bloodline sorcerers](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/13563) have significantly more options now. Othe rmods improve shadow magic, metamagic, and tides of chaos.

## General

There is no longer a mainted list of all the added features and sub-classes in the wiki. The intent is just to summarize major feature changes players will want to know before picking classes.

## Brand New Classes

* [Artificer](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/1779), and all subclasses.
* [Mesmerist](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/11854).
* [Blackguard](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/6612).
* [Inquisitor](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18318).
* [Bloodhunter](https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/blood-hunter#description).

# New and Changed Equipment

## Magic Items, Economy

- Listonomicon incorporates mods that change, rebalance, or improve many vanilla magic items. Many magic items locked to good or evil playthroughs have been redistributed, providing alternate sources or opportunities to get valuable items that might otherwise be missed. An almost-completely-randomized distribution of magic items can be enabled via Random Equipment Loot (look in the optional mods notes, near the bottom of MO2).
- Listonomicon has an attunement and magic item rarity limit, allowing you to equip many, but not every, piece of magic gear you acquire.
- The list is also full of new magic items. Some items exist as static loot, intentionally placed somewhere in the world; added to a specific chest or quest reward; or will be found on the bodies of bosses.
- Overall, you should feel encouraged to change your equipment more frequently than the vanilla game, with fewer “best in slot” choices and with fewer magic items that feel like glorified Gale food.
- Elixirs have been changed, according to [Elixirs Revised](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10073). Please read the mod page and pay closer attention to the description of elixirs in-game, as many of them now stack or work differently. Elixirs of X Giant's Strength have been changed into +STR items, rather than potions that set your Strength to a specific number. This means that characters cannot dump STR, pop a potion, and be fine. It also means that high-Strength characters can still benefit from drinking these elixirs. Healing Potions Hardcore changes HPots to provide a limited immediate healing effect, followed by a delayed healing effect, reducing their combat usefulness compared to healing spells.
- The overall economy and raw acquisition of gold in Listo is intentionally made harder. Between Poor Adventurer-esque changes and the custom difficulty settings, gold is both slower to accumulate and traders have worse prices when buying or selling. Keep in mind that in Listo you are expected to find significantly more magic items during your adventure, and selling anything you don't use will still allow you to afford many shiny goodies.
- You will want to save up your pennies so that when you reach Act 3, you can afford the ship manifest that allows you to embark on the Spelljammer adventure arc. The deed for a ship (sold by Popper in the circus) is very expensive, but the reward for the quest line is having a floating artillery platform overhead for the rest of Act 3.
- You are encouraged to hold onto a variety of weapons to ensure that your team has access to various damage types, as some encounters will now punish/reward the right weapon at the right time.

## Upgrading items

A handful of items in Listonomicon are able to be upgraded by combining certain materials/items.

- [Phalar Aluve](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/2987) can be upgraded with a music box hidden in the Shadow Cursed Lands (Act 2), and upgraded again with a music box hidden in a special part of the Circus that only pickpockets can find (Act 3).
- [Superius Armour](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/15568). The armor pieces themselves have been distributed throughout Act 1 (Ruins bandits, Blurg, Arcane Tower chest, Filro the Forgotten, Filro's chest), and the upgrade materials are magic orbs redistributed throughout the game (Therezzyn, Mason's Guild, Smuggler Cave, Cazador's Ballroom).
- The [Voltstrike Blade](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/15589) can be found on Grym. The first upgrade item is a broken blade, found on the haunted Hollow Armor in Act 2; the final upgrade is Ansur's bones.
- [Psychic Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14476) is a mix of a scavenger/treasure hunt, and upgrade path for various items included within. The Sussur Bloom found in the basement of the Arcane Tower is used for upgrading.
- [FoeBane](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12523) adds a great reward to the Druid Grove questline, which can further be upgraded with a magic scabard in Act 3 (Jaheira's Basement).

## Upgrading Your Avatar

Over the course of playing Listonomicon, players will have two elaborate mods to interact with (or ignore):

[Path of the Righteous](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/16597) is the traditional good guy fantasy. Collect a number of relics and undertake the quests, rituals, and spell casting necessary to restore tarnished artifacts to glory.

[Path of Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/9164) is the inverse. By following esoteric rituals and clues, a player can uncover the means to die - and rise again as a dreaded master of undeath.

## Inventory Management & QoL

- “[WiFi Potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/5080)” changes the way healing potions are managed. You no longer need to worry about splitting stacks and distributing them throughout your team. You should have a single “WiFi Potion” for each healing potion type to place on your hotbar, which will access a corresponding potion from anywhere in your party. Just like magic keys from another character’s pocket!
- Food will be automatically sent to your camp chest when looted or purchased. You can configure this mod with MCM (hit ";") to send, or not to send, alcohol and valuable food to your camp chest.

## Shopping, Merchants, Withers

Withers is now a merchant! Press the trade button at the bottom-left when talking to him. Dyes and camp clothes have been moved off of normal vendors and to Withers, reducing the ridiculous amount of clutter otherwise on each merchant. He has 50,000 gold that resets each time you speak to him, making him the most convenient place to dump your trash pile. He cannot be pickpocketed.

## Bows and Crossbows vs Guns

Artificer and other mods add firearms. The Listo patch/Degreaser plus True Range 5e seeks to rebalance firearms as a category of weapons that is generally stronger than the equivalent bow/crossbow in terms of damage dice, however they have significantly reduced range compared to bows/crossbows. Handcrossbows now have similarly reduced range, meaning they are not able to compete with bows/crossbows for range (but can still be dual wielded).

There is a variety of magic pistols that can be found in Listonomicon. This is from an unreleased mod Jasperthefae was kind enough to give Listo permission to use, until the author has time to assemble a proper Nexus page. Generally, basic and +1 firearms can be purchased from Dammon and Roah Moonglow in Acts 1 and 2, and may crop up in other places here-and-there.

## The Hand, and Eye, of Vecna

Consider these legendary artifacts the evil inverse of the Blood of Lathander. They offer great and tempting power to any who can acquire them, and become even more powerful when both are combined by a single owner. However they come with great risks, as Vecna exudes influence through these unliving links and the gods themselves look down on any mortal fool with the hubris to attempt wielding such profane power.
