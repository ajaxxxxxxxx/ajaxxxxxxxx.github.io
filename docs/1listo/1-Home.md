## **What is Listonomicon?**

Listonomicon is a Wabbajack/MO2-powered mod list for BG3. The passion for compiling this list was born from the unexpected love that BG3 reignited for _Dungeons and Dragons_ - and the success in compiling it has been a gestalt effort of myself, former project members, mod makers, and players. I have sincere respect and appreciation for modders, Wabbajack, MO2 devs, LaughingLeader, MO2-BG3 plugin author Zino, and everyone else who contributes in small and large ways to enable Listo. Without them, Listo couldn't take a great game and make it even greater. True cthonauts of Larian OSIRIS and Script Extender code: Thank you, and thank everyone who contributes their time and talent to the gaming community for free. [Zehtuka](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Zehtuka/mods?gameId=3474) in particular was a big help in configuring and tweaking Combat Extender for Listonomicon, and learning better practices in mod config management in general, Visual Studio Code, and a lot of baby's-first-mod learning. [Reyqune](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/reyqune/mods), the author of BG3 Enhanced Edition, and Baldursgoonsack, author of DIQ, have been huge sources of help on the list development/management side. [BaldursGoonsack](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/BaldursGoonsack/mods?gameId=3474), [Yoesph](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Yoesph/mods?gameId=3474), [Lumaterian](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Lumaterian/mods?gameId=3474), [Chizfreak](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/chizfreak/mods?gameId=3474), Yuuko Shionji, Cahoot, and others have made mods, mod patches, or changes to their mods to better support Listonomicon, and I am endlessly thankful for their contributions and any future help we get from the mod community. This "thank you!" list is not exhaustive, I'm bad at writing down names and remembering everyone. I can't thank everyone enough for their patience and help. Over the final months of 2024, Listo truly transformed into a community effort with a great syncretic blend of mod making and knowledge sharing between Listo makers, players, and modders; DIQ makers, players, and modders; and taking help anywhere else we can get it.

Anyone who enjoys Listonomicon is asked, at a minimum, use MO2’s endorsement feature to show their appreciation to mod makers. Appreciate everyone involved in bringing new content to the game, as well as the facilitators of patches, community frameworks, script extenders, native mod loaders, and the hundred other things that are never seen in game but make the magic happen. Please report issues, crashes, or compatibility problems to Kitchen Sink first! Individual mod makers do not want a flood of bug reports that may or may not be related to their mod, when there are hundreds of variables caused by the big list of Listonomicon.

Finally, a big “Thank you!” again to the cthnonauts who volunteered to struggle with us through the many updates, hotfixes, community polls, tests, and revisions to reach Listonomicon 1.0. You helped us with everything from improving this documentation, to how we present Listo info, mod configurations, difficulty tweaks, new mods to include, and a better path to 1.0 and beyond than we would have found without you. Some of you spent hours diagnosing multiplayer issues, or figuring out why heads were missing in character creation, and gave us the confidence to keep going after an exhausted v0.9 release. 1.0 would not be released with confidence without the help, support, fun, memes, screenshots, complaints, suggestions, testing, and love of the BYC community. Listo 2.0, the big move to no longer require BG3MM (and to reduce the install process by 4 steps!), was made possible by the hard work and testing of Zino, who published the newer better faster smarter MO2-BG3 plugin. Listo 3.0 was built on the feedback, help, and involvement of the community across polls and good conversations. Listo 4.0+ has seen the move of Listonomicon to its own community, the Kitchen Sink, which quickly surpassed 500 members - and almost another 500 joined by the time v5.0 added Patch 8 compatability. I'm glad you are here and I hope you feel encouraged to tell me what you like, and don't like, about your Listo experience.

## What IS a Listonomicon?

Listonomicon, or "Listo," is a mod list for BG3 intended to add more content, depth, challenge, and variety. It takes the vanilla Tactician Difficulty/Honour Mode Ruleset experience as the baseline, and then adds new encounters, mechanics, and changes. The player is empowered with new choices in race, background, class, subclass, feats, spells, and equipment - but your enemy is likewise enhanced with access to both more vanilla features, and features taken from the very mods used by the player! The Listo world is more magical, with the player and enemies alike seeing an increase in power. Generally, Listo is balanced around the player having a level cap of 20, and using a party of 4-6 heroes. You are expected to already be familiar with the majority of BG3's features, and should come prepared to finally make use of all those scrolls, healing potions, poisons, elixirs, weapon coats, arrows, and other resources you may have previously neglected. The goal is not, however, to be some impossible, hard-as-nails, make-yourself-miserable ultra hardmode slog fest and Listo should never make you feel forced to cheese encounters or abuse mechanics. Listo wants to be a "D&D-first challenge," not a video game-y grind.

:::caution
## **What is it Not?**
Listonomicon aims to achieve a transformation from a vanilla first playthrough, to a premium overhauled experience that keeps everything good about BG3 while adding more content. **If you want a more lightweight list to use as a basis/platform/framework for your own modding**, I recommend you use [Reyqune's BG3 Enhanced Edition](https://github.com/reyqune/Baldur-s-Gate-3-Enhanced-Edition/blob/main/README.md). If you want a comprehensive overhaul to BG3 but just don't like the way that Listonomicon has done it, I recommend you look at [Difficulty, Immersion, Quality](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv) (there are multiple versions of this Nexus Collection with more or less customization options).

What Listonomicon absolutely is not:

- Gratuitous adult content frameworks or mods.
- A “Kitchen Sink” compilation. Every mod inclusion is considered for how it is expected to contribute to or disrupt the overall gameplay experience. If you want a modlist that includes as many mods as possible, every customization option on Nexus, and every class and subclass, play [Infinite Pathways](https://github.com/Millionsfrost/N.Y.A-NSFW-Modlist-Skyrim/blob/main/BG3_Infinite_Pathways.md).
- Classes, subclasses, races, feats, spells, magic items, or other options that are out of place. You should only see content that feels like something you might find in BG3 normally - or, at most, something that is within the realm of a creative Dungeon Master who loves buying Kobold Press, Pathfinder, OSR, and other high-quality, setting-agnostic books.
- Cheats, tutorial chests full of goodies, or an easier game. If anything, Listonomicon should feel more challenging and harder to predict than the vanilla game, if you play according to the guide (customized difficulty on Listonomicon settings, 6 party limit or smaller). Note that "More challenging" is not the same thing as "More difficult" - Listo is probably overall harder than vanilla, but the goal is to challenge you to flex your RPG and problem solving muscles and feel like critical thinking is applied in a rewarding way to encounters. We do not want you to autopilot through an easy game, and we don't want you pulling your hair out at a frustrating one.
- The intention to please everyone. This list is assembled according to our taste and vision. Fortunately, adding or removing mods from MO2 is pretty easy - feel free to use Listonomicon as a baseline, and then void any support on our Discord if you decide to customize!
- A list to play in “Honour Mode.” The features of Honour Mode (such as enhanced bosses, smarter enemies, and tweaked game mechanics) can be enabled in custom game rules, without being limited to a single save. It is not a good idea to mix ironman restrictions with heavily modded games.
- An intentionally punishing, grueling, unfair, unfun experience. Listonomicon should feel fresh, exciting, and challenging with many unexpected, changed, or completely new encounters - but it should not feel like an angry DM is dumping an impossible stat block on you at every turn and denying the fun of sword and sorcery fantasy.
:::

## **Customizing the List**
No support is offered or guaranteed for anyone who modifies the behavior or contents of Listonomicon. It is already difficult to keep up with new mods daily on the Nexus; updates and changes to mods in the list; changes in the script extender; new and changed features in the community compatibility frameworks; as well as game patches and hotfixes; vanilla game bugs; and the consequences of (seemingly) minor mod setting tweaks on gameplay. Further modify the list at your own peril. We hope that you are able to customize a fun, stable, great experience tailored to your specific tastes using Listonomicon as a stepping stone - but will not offer troubleshooting or technical support. There is a number of "Optional" mods included in Listo for players who want certain QoL or challenge features where we will try to help, but do not endorse that the end result will be balanced or fun or sane! If you are customizing the list and trying to play multiplayer, please be aware that your mod list, including the exact order mods are in, MUST be the same as all COOP friends. Otherwise MP will break. In fact many things break BG3 MP so you will need to do a lot of troubleshooting.

## **How do I Get Help?**
1.) Make sure to read the installation guide and **follow it in order**. Make sure you have a fresh install of Baldur's Gate 3, launched vanilla via Steam at least once, and nuked %appdata%/local/larian studios to wipe out any non-Listo mod files you may have. Try using the dx11 and the Vulkan version of the game.

2.) The next step would be to check our FAQ

3.) If your issue is not in the FAQ or Installation Guide, take the time to look around Listo's documentation (especially if it's a gameplay related questions). Major changes to classes and game mechanics have been explained, including links to the relevant mods.

4.) If your question is unanswered in our documentation, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/AmxvjHkQ5v). Please look through the Listo Help Centre, in addition to looking through pins, announcements, and using the search function.

5.) If after your searches you still cannot find your issue, make a help post in #general-help, or make a bug report in #listo-bug-report.

### DO NOT ASK USERS IN THE BALDUR'S GATE 3 OR OTHER DISCORDS FOR HELP

Please source all help to our discord alone. Even if you think that your question relates to your installation of Baldur's Gate 3 itself, please bring it into our discord. The authors of the many, many mods of Listonomicon do not want to diagnose problems in a list this large. Give us the first chance to make sure any issues you face are not Listo-specific, before asking for help elsewhere.

## Why play Listonomicon?

![Features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Listonomicon-Team/Listonomicon/refs/heads/main/ad.png)

The tl;dr is that I really enjoyed playing BG3, and wanted to add more on top of it, fix bugs, make QoL tweaks, and see more of my favorite elements of _Dungeons and Dragons_ represented in game. Listo does not see a reason to dramatically change the game or add scoops of strange, foreign content for the sake of more content. Just more BG3, more D&D, more fun. That is why in the philosophy described below, you will hopefully see a mix of exciting new content _and_ sensible restraint. Per the picture above, Listo is the premier Wabbajack-powered, ModOrganizer 2-using BG3 mod list that includes the best, lore friendly, pro-tabletop mods of Nexus _and_ Mod.io. It is also DVORAK compatible.

### Classes and Subclasses

Classes and Subclasses should represent something that exists in official D&D material or high-quality, setting-agnostic third party publications, makes sense in the Forgotten Realms (sorry my fellow _DragonMech_ and _Dragonstar_ fans), and compliments Larian’s design. It must work within the Compatibility Framework, and it must have level scaling to 20. Anything that requires unusual deviation or disruption to the regular flow of gameplay, such as a class that introduces an obnoxious number of toggle abilities or changes to the action economy or impacts the basic features of other classes, will most likely not be considered for inclusion. Classes and subclasses should follow their book/tabletop counterparts as closely as practical, with minimal changes to translate to the game.

### Magic Weapons, Armor, and Items

New gear should reasonably exist in the Forgotten Realms. The design philosophy and distribution (as static loot, or new random loot table entries or shopkeeper inventory) should match Larian’s progression expectations and design sensibility. Vanilla gear that is changed should avoid “over tuning” and changes should focus on making items more interesting, under-used items more compelling, or provide Quality of Life changes to awkward mechanics or descriptions.

### Feats, Class Features, and Progression

New feats should add interesting options. Revised feats (nerfed or buffed or just tweaked) should prevent any options from feeling mandatory, polarizing, or weak. The progression of feats every 3 levels, instead of 4, allows more feats to be chosen over the course of the game; allows builds to come together sooner (such as polearm/sentinel tanks); and it allows multi-class dips to grab their 3rd level subclass features without having to choose a 4th level or miss a feat. Level progression should be faster than the base game, allowing players who do most content to reach level 15+ and completionists to reach level 18+. Enabling any optional additional content (such as Many More Monsters and/or DHM) will definitely allow thorough players to reach level 20. New classes/subclasses must scale to level 20.

### Engaging Combat and Difficulty Curve

Enemy casters should have access to 5e, PF2e, and Homebrew spells, plus most additional spells added to Listo from other mods. The list enables Honour Mode mechanics, including legendary actions added to boss fights. And with Combat Extender, many enemies and bosses have been given direct upgrades to enhance the challenge. CX is further used to distribute many of the new feats, abilities, magic item effects, and options given to players across various enemies. In other words, changes to the world are not exclusively in the player's favor - just as you have access to a wider variety of tools, so do your foes!

### Multiplayer Compatibility

There is no promise that coop will never be sacrificed due to a future mod being incompatible, but too compelling to leave out of Listo. However, for the time being, Listo remains functional for a full, fun, multiplayer experience (with a handful of vanilla MP bugs).

### A Platform to Enable Your Fun

At the end of the day, Listo's goal is to give you even more BG3. But you may disagree with how we do that, the mod settings we use, and what mods we choose to use or exclude. That's fine and doesn't hurt our feelings :) While we do not promise any help or support, you are encouraged to explore making your own Wabbajack List if you think you can do better. In fact, you are welcome to use Listonomicon as a baseline and make your tweaks from there, including copying any mod settings or Listo's heavily customized Combat Extender config. Please read our [mod identification tracker notes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_dZdM_16xeE4yIqKYyk7HMjLI3WW7PhfpdlrKHM4vyg/edit?usp=sharing) to get an understanding of our choices, what mods we have tested, and why Listo is the way it is - it will be easier to make something better if you can skip repeating the same mistakes we did! If you want a more lightweight platform to work from, I recommend [BG3 Enhanced Edition](https://github.com/reyqune/Baldur-s-Gate-3-Enhanced-Edition/blob/main/README.md) (which will have a much more simple list of mods to build up from). If you want a comprehensive mod list prepared for you, but don't like the way Listo does it, try [DIQ](https://next.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv) and its many sub-lists.

### Have suggestions to make Listonomicon better?

The easiest way to get in touch with us is to join our Discord. Make sure to verify that you are a human via #verification, and then post your suggestions in #suggestions. Familiarize yourself with the list's philosophy before suggesting things that will be categorically denied (such as classes that lack level 20 progression, anime katanas, or mechs).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What is Listonomicon?
A: Listonomicon (or "Listo") is a Wabbajack/MO2-powered mod list for Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3). It aims to add more content, depth, challenge, and variety to the game, building upon the vanilla Tactician Difficulty/Honour Mode Ruleset. It includes new encounters, mechanics, races, classes, spells, and equipment, while also enhancing enemies by giving them access to vanilla abilities they normally lack, and by giving them access to some of the new spells, class features, and abilities available for players. Many QoL enhancements are also included, as well as tweaked vanilla mechanics to resolve annoying "Larianisms" where possible without sacrificing everything Larian did well.

### Q: Who is Listonomicon for?
A: Listonomicon is for players familiar with BG3 who are looking for an overhauled experience with more D&D elements. It's balanced for a party of 4-6 heroes with a level cap of 20. It is not recommended for a first playthrough.

### Q: What if I want a lighter modlist or a different overhaul?
A: For a more lightweight list to build upon, Listo recommends Reyqune's BG3 Enhanced Edition. For a different comprehensive overhaul, you could look at the Difficulty, Immersion, Quality (DIQ) Nexus Collection. For a "kitchen sink" compilation with maximum content, Infinite Pathways is an option.

### Q: Can I customize Listonomicon?
A: While you can add or remove mods using MO2, no support is offered for customized versions of Listonomicon. If you customize and play multiplayer, ensure your mod list and load order are identical to your friend's.

### Q: Where can I get help if I have issues?
A: First, ensure you've followed the installation guide, including a fresh BG3 install and grabbing the prequisities. Check the official FAQ and documentation. If your issue persists, join the Discord, look through existing resources (pins, announcements, search), and then post in the appropriate help or bug report channel. Do **not** ask for Listo-specific help in general BG3 Discords or on individual mod pages, mod authors uninvolved in Listonomicon do not want to deal with Listonomicon questions/issues.

## Installation

### Q: What are the main requirements to install Listonomicon?
A: You'll need:
    * Around 60 GB of disk space (some reclaimable after install).
    * A legal copy of Baldur's Gate 3, launched at least once vanilla.
    * Wabbajack installed.
    * A Nexus account (Premium is recommended for speed).
    * Specific versions of Microsoft Visual C++ x64 and .NET Runtimes (8.x.x Desktop x64 and 6.0 Desktop x64) installed.

### Q: Do I need to install Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) or BG3 Mod Manager separately?
A: **No.** A portable instance of MO2 comes with the Listonomicon Wabbajack download. You do not need the standalone BG3 Mod Manager, BG3 Script Extender (it's pre-packaged), or Vortex.

### Q: What are the key steps for installing Listonomicon?
A:
    1.  Read all requirements carefully, especially the Visual C++ and .NET installations.
    2.  **Highly Recommended**: "Nuke" your BG3 installation by completely uninstalling it, deleting the game folder, and deleting the `%localappdata%\Larian Studios` folder. Reinstall BG3, preferably not in a default Steam location like `Program Files (x86)` but closer to the root of your drive (e.g., `D:/Games/BG3/...`).
    3.  Launch the freshly installed vanilla BG3 once to the main menu to generate necessary folders.
    4.  Create a Listonomicon installation folder (e.g., `D:/Listonomicon`).
    5.  Find Listonomicon on the Wabbajack gallery. If you want a specific Listo version, find the appropriate `Listonomicon.wabbajack` on the Listo Nexus page. You can also grab a copy of `Listonomicon LITE.wabbajack` from Nexus, which is a smaller Listo download with cosmetic mods excluded.
    6.  Configure Steam to "Only Update This Game When I Launch It" for BG3 and avoid launching BG3 through Steam.
    7.  Launch ModOrganizer.exe from the folder where you installed Listonomicon. Verify the profile at the top says "Listonomicon v[whatever version you are trying to play]" and that the active mod count matches the info on the Listo install instructions page.
    8.  Launch the game (Vulkan or DX11) through MO2.

### Q: What if I install Listo on a different drive than BG3 and the game doesn't launch?
A: In MO2, go to the puzzle pieces icon (Tools) -> Rootbuilder -> Open Rootbuilder. On the first page, change the mode from “Link” to “Copy”. You will have to repeat this step after updating Listo.

### Q: What in-game settings are crucial?
A: You **must** change "Animation Level of Detail" to "High" in your Visual Settings to avoid visual bugs with modded heads. Other graphics settings can be adjusted to your PC's performance.

### Q: How should I start a new campaign for the intended experience?
A:
    1.  Start a new game on **Custom Difficulty**.
    2.  In the Custom Difficulty menu, click "Restore Default".
    3.  **CRITICAL:** change the "Ruleset" at the top from Normal to **Honour**. Failure to do this will prevent many Listo features from working, and you won't be able to equip magic items.

### Q: My hotbar looks weird/some abilities are missing! How do I fix it?
A: Depending on your monitor setup, you might need to slide the red dividers on your hotbar to the left to unlock its full space. See the gif on the install page.

### Q: How do I update Listonomicon?
A: Point Wabbajack to your existing Listonomicon installation location, an enable the option to overwrite. Wabbajack will only download changed or new mods unless you have deleted the `downloads` folder. After updating, delete the `Overwrites` folder in your Listonomicon install folder. You can also clear the Overwrite in MO2 by right-clicking the red "Overwrite" text at the bottom of your mods list, and select "Clear Overwrite".

## Gameplay & Balance

### Q: What is "Attunement" in Listonomicon?
A: Attunement limits the number of powerful magic items a character can use simultaneously. Each character can be attuned to a maximum of 5 items. Additionally, there are limits on how many items of a certain rarity (Rare, Very Rare, Legendary) you can equip, with further restrictions on armor and accessory slots for Very Rare and Legendary items. Generic +1/+2 gear, adamantine items, and weaker/niche items generally do not require attunement.

### Q: How is combat different in Listonomicon?
A: Listonomicon uses mods like "More Enemies in Basic Fights", "Encounters Overhaul", and "Vulkrana's Undead Encounters" to add more enemies and new encounters. Combat Extender (CX) is used to give enemies (including those from mods) new spells, abilities, class features, feats, and magic item effects, mirroring player enhancements. Early game encounters (pre-Blighted Village) are somewhat nerfed or redesigned for a smoother start, but later encounters are more challenging. Act 3, in particular, has significantly buffed enemies and bosses.

### Q: What party size is recommended?
A: 4 to 6 party members. Using more will decrease difficulty, fewer will increase it. Be aware that having more than 4 party members can cause issues with some in-game events (e.g. riding boats to Grymforge) or characters falling off elevators.

### Q: How does Initiative work?
A: Initiative is rolled as d8 + dexterity modifier + bonuses. This can be changed via the Mod Configuration Menu (MCM).

### Q: How can I adjust the difficulty?
A:
    * **Easier**:
        1.  In Custom Difficulty settings, reduce the trader price penalty (e.g., to x3.5) and camp supply cost.
        2.  Use the "Easy CombatExtender.json" file by renaming the existing `CombatExtender.json` in `[Listo Install Location]\mods\zzz_ListonomiconModSettings\SE_CONFIG` and then renaming `Easy CombatExtender.json` to `CombatExtender.json`.
    * **Harder**:
        1.  Enable optional mods like "Absolute Wrath" and/or "Champions of Faerun".
        2.  Use the "Hard CombatExtender.json" file similarly by renaming it to `CombatExtender.json`.
        3.  Consider enabling "Deadlier Honour Mode (DHM) Bosses and Encounters" for very challenging optional content.

### Q: What is the Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)?
A: The MCM allows you to tweak settings for various mods. You can access it by pausing the game and selecting the MCM option, or by pressing the semicolon key (`;`). You may need to save and reload a new game once for it to become fully functional.

## Spells, Feats, Classes & Items

### Q: Are there new spells in Listonomicon?
A: Yes, many. Listonomicon includes spells from "5e Spells," "Homebrew Spells," "Spells Extra," a patched version of "PF2e Spells," "Mystra Spells" (from Mod.io), "Veenab Spells," Dawnstar's "Psychic Spells" and "Water Spells," among others. Many of these are also available to enemies.

### Q: How are existing spells rebalanced?
A: Spells are rebalanced based on Valdacil's adjustment mods, with additional changes from Syrchalis, Cahoot, and Ajax. Examples:
    * Hex and Hunter's Mark are cast once to prepare, then a separate "Hex Target" or "Mark Target" ability is used as a bonus action to apply/reapply the effect without using more spell slots.
    * Shield of Faith lasts until long rest and doesn't require concentration.
    * Speak with Animals and Longstrider are AoE and last until long rest.
    * Shillelagh is permanent (cast again to disable the effect) and applies to more weapon types.
    * Illithid Powers are significantly revamped.

### Q: How do Feats work?
A: All classes get a feat every 3 levels (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18). Fighters, Mesmerists, and Rogues get an additional feat at level 11. Many vanilla feats are rebalanced (e.g., GWM/Sharpshooter, Tough, Durable), and new feats like Arcanist Feat, Essential Feats (War Magic, Deadly Alacrity, Alchemist, etc.), Enweaved, Experimental Alchemy Feat, and Dirty Fighting are added.

### Q: Are there new classes or subclasses?
A: Yes. Listonomicon adds many new subclasses for existing classes and entirely new classes like Artificer, Mystic, Inquisitor, Blackguard and Mesmerist. All classes/subclasses can be played to level 20 and/or multiclassed.

### Q: How is Wild Magic affected?
A: Wild Magic Sorcerers and Barbarians have access to more effects (over 220+ total from multiple mods). Surge risk for Sorcerers increases by 5% per spell cast in combat until a surge, which then recharges Tides of Chaos. If Volo dies, all magic becomes wild magic. Many enemies use Wild Magic-adjacent mechanics like magic allergy or Controlled Chaos.

### Q: What changes are there to equipment and economy?
A:
    * Many vanilla items are rebalanced or improved. Some good/evil playthrough locked items are redistributed.
    * New magic items are added as static loot, quest rewards, for sale on vendors, or on bosses.
    * Elixirs are rebalanced (e.g., Giant Strength potions are +STR, not Set STR).
    * Healing Potions are less effective in direct combat (heal over time component).
    * Gold is harder to accumulate due to lower sell prices, higher buy prices (x4 default), and less gold from quests/loot.
    * "WiFi Potions" allow you to use healing potions from any party member's inventory by having one of that type on your hotbar.
    * Food is automatically sent to the camp chest.
    * Withers is a merchant for dyes, camp clothes, and miscellaneous items, and has 50,000 gold.
