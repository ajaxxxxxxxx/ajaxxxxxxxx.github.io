**[Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565)**

Features:

* A New Land to Explore: Travel north across the Sea of Ghosts to the island of Wyrmstooth in pursuit of a dragon. Delve into one of the largest dungeons in Tamriel with a cadre of mercenaries at your disposal.

* Your Home is Your Castle: Purchase an abandoned imperial fort from Lurius Liore, make it your own, hire new staff, and defend it from unwanted visitors.

* New Weapons, Shields, Spells, and a new Shout: Treasures sequestered across the island reward those with a keen sense of exploration...and a keener ability to fend off danger lurking in the depths of the many dungeons found across the island.

Wyrmstooth adds a new quest that takes the Dragonborn to the island of Wyrmstooth situated north of Solitude across the Sea of Ghosts. Battle across new landscapes and through new dungeons in this expansion-sized mod. The task may seem simple enough: slay a dragon that's stirring up trouble. But things never quite go that easily...

**[College of Winterhold - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66666)**

Features:

* 7 New Quests for the College of Winterhold.
* These quests are not your "save the world" epic questlines, but basic entry-level College of Winterhold apprentice lessons.
* They all mostly follow the basic principle of: Talk to the magic professor, they will lecture you about their school of magic, teach you a new spell and provide you with a problem where you need to use the spell to succeed. Learn by doing!
* You must complete these 7 quests to unlock the continuation of the vanilla College of Winterhold quest line (Going to Saarthal). This means when you first join the College, you will be "forced" to learn a bit about magic before being thrown into Saarthal.
* All new quests are fully voiced using spliced dialogue.
* There are no dead ends: Quests can be completed in any order and there's always an objective marker guiding you towards what you need to do next. In some cases, you can opt out of some of these quests or take alternative paths resulting in different outcomes.

Tired of the College of Winterhold not actually teaching you any magic? Tired of jumping into Saarthal after your very first lesson? This mod provides 7 new starter magic lessons/quests to make your College of Winterhold feel like an actual school of magic.

**[The Paarthurnax Dilemma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/365)**

Disappointed with how ruthless and unforgiving the Blades were at the end of the main quest? Felt like you should have been able to put your foot down and make them see reason? Well now you can!

This mod is a simple, yet badly needed modification to the post-MQ quest the Blades give you to kill Paarthurnax.

Approach the quest as usual. Listen to the Greybeards and Paarthurnax.

Should you decide to spare his life, return to Delphine or Esbern and explain it to them. You may have to be a bit forceful in the process. They may not like what you're telling them, but they're supposed to be there to serve the Dragonborn, right?

Should you choose to go through with slaying him, he will not be alone. Paarthurnax told you he was going to try and teach others the Way of the Voice, and he'll have his first group of students listening intently. Or, well, whatever dragons do when they're perched on rocks looking at each other.

Are you a ruthless savage like your Blade companions, or will you show compassion and forgiveness the Blades don't appear to be capable of anymore? Make your choice, Dragonborn!

**[Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849)**

An amazing quest mod made by Vicn, requiring the player to join the Vigilants of Stendarr and help them keep Skyrim safe from the influence of malevolent forces... And then a certain Daedric Prince takes a very personal interest in the newest member of the Vigilants.

_**IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST PLAYTHROUGH OF THE MOD, DO NOT LISTEN TO ORLANDO. DO NOT DO WHAT HE WANTS AT ANY POINT. IGNORE HIM. DON'T EVEN TALK TO TO HIM IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE NO SELF-CONTROL AND ABSOLUTELY MUST DO WHATEVER AN NPC TELLS YOU TO DO. YOU'LL REGRET IT.**_
