But, that doesn't mean you can't level up and right that wrong. Craft stuff, talk to people, sell stuff, sneak around, run around, get hit, kill goats (or other things that can't hit back). All these things advance one skill or another. And once you got that precious levelup, you can get that perk that makes you hit harder, or longer, or more often, and show those bandits who's boss.
