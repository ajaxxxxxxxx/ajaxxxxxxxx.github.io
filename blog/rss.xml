<p>Hey folks! Been a bit since our last update and wanted to get out some minor fixes/additions asap to everyone :). The biggest fix was getting the desert ranger and ranger armors back to being visible, but other minor fixes have been made as well. In addition to this, the start of the game has been changed. Now, instead of leaving the vault, looting the corpses outside to get your starting gear, and moving from there, you will be given less gear. The tradeoff to this is that the gear will be more specific to your chosen tag skills and higher stats. In addition, you will now be given the option upon leaving the Vault to start your adventure in several different areas of the map. This allows the chance to start somewhere you haven't in the past and maybe begin a playthrough much different than you have before! If you're interested in a full list of additions, removals, updates, etc please check the release notes above. As always, thank you guys for continuing to play Capital Punishment, your bug reports, and I hope your holidays and breaks have been great!</p>]]></content:encoded>

There may be some lingering issues or bugs that I have not fixed, but a majority of these are those that have been there for a while and are planned to be worked on for 1.5.5.0.

<p>Capital Punishment's 1.5.5.0 release is upon us and has released with a few bug fixes, reworked LODs, and quite a few other changes. If you are curious, you may (as always) check the link above regarding what exactly has changed. Currently, one thing I will note in this announcement is the delay of BSA packaging our resources and completely solving performance issues. BSA packing, as you guys have seen, has been causing a lot of issues with LOD's looking funky. While I work on solving why this is happening, we will be sticking to loose files for our large scale texture packs/LOD's which will have some performance hit compared to packed BSAs. On the topic of performance, while I have made some much needed adjustments and removals which positively benefited performance (on my end), performance has always and will be an uphill battle for the foreseeable future. Please read the sections I have below in regards to all of this</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-game-is-running-pretty-slow-what-can-i-do-to-increase-frames">My game is running pretty slow, what can I do to increase frames?<a href="https://www.modlists.net/blog/7#my-game-is-running-pretty-slow-what-can-i-do-to-increase-frames" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My game is running pretty slow, what can I do to increase frames?" title="Direct link to My game is running pretty slow, what can I do to increase frames?">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Make no mistake, who doesn't wan't to run a modlist with all the bells and whistles? That being said, the high profile is not designed for every single machine out there. If you are experiencing lag, try first switching to a lower profile.</li>
<li>If switching profiles only provides minimally positive results, try installing <a href="https://www.modlists.net/docs/2capitalpunishment/InstallGuide/Performance-Tweaks#downgrade-to-nvhr-32" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NVHR</a>. THIS CAN BE DONE AT ANY POINT IN YOUR PLAYTHROUGH</li>
<li>If none of these work for you or your issues still persist, then refer to <a href="https://performance.moddinglinked.com/falloutnv.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall's Performance Guide</a></li>

<p>This update fixes a few minor bugs I found throughout the last release that were brought to my attention/that I found whilst testing while also adding in the very anticipated (by the staff at least) addition - Radiant Questing! If you're curious about how this works, check it our yourself in game :).</p>
<p><strong>Removing NVAC; A  (Not So) Small Ending Message</strong></p>
<p>I have been very hesitant to remove New Vegas Anti Crash for the last 6 months. While I know that any good list should not have it installed, it has been a long time crutch (or so we thought) for Capital Punishment considering the sheer amount we have added, let alone some mods we know that cause issues we are unable to fix.</p>
<p>Recent testing with it disabled using the latest release of NVHR has posed positive results on my end, making me fairly confident that the list can and has been able to be independent of NVAC for a while.</p>
<p>Of course, if you notice a large amount of crashes occur, especially those which are reproduceable, use #ttw-bug-report and let us know. It will be there optionally for those who would like the comfort of having it enabled like I have all of these months.</p>
<p>For the time being, I have disabled NVAC, but have left it under our new Optional Installations &amp; Performance tab. If you have any performance issues going forward, please utilize our wiki that we have taken the time to write. Many users have been able to install NVHR, DXVK, and other resources mentioned here with positive results.</p>

<p>This update further fixes LOD's and adds back NVAC, the long winded message left with 1545 was one I should have waited to send before I was sure there were no issues so my apologies. The focus of 1.5.5.0 will be to see if NVAC will be a permanent dependency or one we can get rid of. Thank you to everyone for being so patient with us as we release numerous hotfixes and updates and we appreciate the continued support as always.</p>
<p>If you continue to experience the same crashes with this hotfix, please let us know in #"Crashing on Launch Megathread - 1.5.4.6"</p>

<p>After much deliberation between @mctiddies4lunch and myself, we have decided to cancel Forlorn Hope. This isn't a decision we made lightly as we put a lot of time into building it, but realized it did not really pique our interest anymore. This doesn't mean we will change our minds and create an entirely new Fallout 4 list, but for the time being we have decided against moving forward with Forlorn Hope itself. Thank you to everyone who has eagerly awaited its release and know that while we may not be releasing this list, we are actively working on our current ones/have others that we plan to bring to you guys in the future</p>

<p>As you guys have seen, the updates have been pretty abundant for these two lists as of recent. We apologize for the constant updating and announcements, but know it comes from a good place to want to make these lists the best they can be. We'll still be doing these large scale kinds of updates, but likely slowing update consistency down a bit so that you guys aren't always scrambling to get the newest version,</p>

<p>This update updates a couple of mods, fixes some bug/crash issues, but most importantly packs all of our large worldspace edits into BSA files. This is to ensure the best possible performance on all systems, and should both increase performance and decrease load times.</p>

<p>This release only makes it so that 4 GB Patcher patches your game on its own, effectively removing an unneeded install step. This is not a required download for users who have already downloaded 1532 and followed the added step, but is a useful update for those who have not updated/installed yet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We have decided to spread out even further in the realms of social media and open up a subreddit! This will be another place where we will be posting our updates and interacting with you fine folks, but also a place where you can share your screenshots, clips, make help posts, and much more! While the rudimentary functionality and design is in place, there are still some nitpicks to go. Regardless, we hope this new platform is well received and would love to see you guys on it when you have the chance</p>

<p>This next update is probably the largest update since the release of 1.5 itself (possibly even rivaling 1.5 in terms of scale). Primarily, this update has focused on visuals but also adds quite a big change we did not think we'd be able to implement</p>

<p>With rootbuilder, you now can rely on your own installation of Fallout: New Vegas to play <strong>without</strong> modifying your base install! This also allows for potential use of other Fallout: New Vegas copies to install Capital Punishment (Ex: GOG).</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is mainly a hotfix for some of the bugs that have been encountered so far, although the weather has been changed from NAT 2018 to NAT 3 and several optional ENBs are now available to choose from (with a new section on the install guide) and some QOL mods have been added in from suggestions. If updating from an existing save, some funkiness from weather is possible so it's recommended before updating to first get to an interior location and save. Smart Training will also have to be activated but can only be activated on a save where training has not been performed at that level. The MCM recorder has also been updated to account for this so new saves won't have to worry about that, and time flies has been toned down.</p>]]></content:encoded>
