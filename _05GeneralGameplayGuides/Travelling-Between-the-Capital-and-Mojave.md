# **How to Travel from the Capital to the Mojave**
**This guide contains spoilers for the TTW quest "There & Back Again" in addition to location spoilers for the game. In addition it was taken directly from the TTW forums. Credits to [pintocat here](https://taleoftwowastelands.com/viewtopic.php?t=6730)**

**Step 1:** First, from The Mall make your way East towards the Capitol Building then North towards the National Archives.

**Step 2:** Next, your destination is the Penn. Ave/The Mall Metro which is located behind the Archives.

**Step 3:** Once inside the metro, continue straight down the hall and on to the elevated platform (mind the feral ghouls). Direct your gaze over the side of the platform to the right/East. You will notice that one of the train tunnels is free of rubble.

**Step 4:** To continue on to the station, take the exit at the end of the tunnel to Judiciary Square Metro (yes, this is a new area) which will lead you to a new DC mall area. With a little bit of exploration you will find the station building. Additionally, here is an overhead composite map of the layout of The Mall with the Penn. Ave./The Mall dungeon highlighted in yellow.
