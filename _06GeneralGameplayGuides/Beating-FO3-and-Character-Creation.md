## **Character Creation**
Make sure to set up your character to an optimal build you like. Tag skills, perks, and skill points matter! You will only receive 8-12 skill points per level dependent on intelligence and leveling is SLOW. In addition you will not receive double skill points on your tag skills. If you do not know what the special skills or the skills affect I would suggest reading carefully through each as you go through character creation. Be sure to check out any future builds posted by fellow users!

## **Beating FO3 & Playing Post-Game**
When you are about to beat Fallout 3, make sure to send Sarah Lyons or a companion inside as well! Otherwise the game will end and you will not continue into the DLC and be able to play post end game
