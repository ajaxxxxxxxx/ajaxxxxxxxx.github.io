## DO NOT ASK THE TALE OF TWO WASTELANDS OR OTHER DISCORDS FOR HELP

Tale of Two Wastelands does not endorse this mod list and in addition, does not have the resources or time to help with problems regarding it. Please source all help to our discord alone. Even if you think that your question relates to your installation of Tale of Two Wastelands itself, please bring it into our discord.

## **General Questions to Ask Yourself Before Seeking Help**

1.) Have you looked at the installation guide?

2.) What Platform Is Your New Vegas Downloaded On? (If on Steam is it a Global, Non-English or PCR Copy?)

3.) Which directory is your New Vegas, Fallout 3, & Modlist Downloaded To?

4.) Have you installed the Visual C++ Runtime Libraries? 

5.) Have you tried verifying your Fallout New Vegas installation, then tried the download process again?

6.) Do you have an antivirus installed and functioning? 

## **How do I Get Help?**
1.) Make sure to look at the installation guide and follow in order.

2.) The next step would be to check our [FAQ](https://themrnewvegas.github.io/01Support/FAQ/)

3.) If your issue is not in the FAQ or Installation Guide, take the time to look around the Wiki (Especially if its gameplay related questions such as "How do I Repair Guns?"

4.) If your question is unanswered in our documentation, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/43EhRjU). Some fixes that we have included there are not integrated to the wiki yet. Please look through our #ttw-help, #fixes, #ttw-bug-reports, in addition to looking through pins, announcements, and using the search function

5.) If after your searches you still cannot find your issue, make a help post in #ttw-help on our discord and we will get to it as soon as possible!
