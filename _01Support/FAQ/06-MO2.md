## **1.) How do I stop MO2 from launching Vanilla Fallout New Vegas?**

{: .note}
> This is due to the game MO2 is sourcing to not being in your Stock Game directory. While you may have the launched exe sourced to your stock game folder, your MO2 has a separate area in which you need to change your managed game.

- Go to the top left of MO2, then go to settings

- In the popup window, select the option 'Paths'

- A window like this will show, at the very bottom you will see the tab "Managed Game". You need to change this to your FalloutNV.exe that is in the stock games folder

## **2.) I am still launching into Vanilla Fallout New Vegas.**

- Go to the top right of MO2 and click the dropdown menu

- From that menu select '<Edit>'

- Look through your Tale of Two Wastelands, Fallout Launcher, NVSE, & Virtual Folder Paths. Make sure they are all pointing in similar directions as mine/in the direction where these files are located

- Try to launch the game now. If it still launches to Vanilla open up a help post
